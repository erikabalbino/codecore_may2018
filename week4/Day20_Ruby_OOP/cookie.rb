# In Ruby, we define classes with the `class` keyword.
# By convention, we use CapitalizedCamelCase for class
# names. However, the file contains class

# It's best practice to create one file per class.

    # instance of a class including class methods.

    # The method below is defined as a `class` method
    # which means that it can only be called by the
    # class itself. It's not useable by instance of
    # Cookie.
    # Example: Cookie.info
  
    # `self.` whithin a class block refers to the class,
    # but inside a method it refers to the instance
    # calling the method.
    def self.info
      # Class method can use a class variable
      # Inside a class method, self refers to the class.
  
      # We can the name of an object with ".name" method.
      # This useful to display the name of the class.
      "I'm the #{self.name} class and I create #{@@color} cookies"

    # `initialize` is a special method that is called 
    # every time an instance is created. This is Ruby's
    # version of the `constructor` method.

    def initialize(sugar, butter)
      # Initialize can use a class variable
      puts "Creating a #{@@color} cookie ð©âð³ ðª ..."
      # Variables prefixed with @ are called instance variables.
      # They only exist within the instance class meaning that
      # ALL instance methods can used them.

    # The instance method `sugar` is an attribute reader,
    # because it returns the value of the instance variable
    # @sugar. In some languages, this is called a getter.
    def sugar
      @sugar
    end
    # usage: Cookie.new(10, 20).sugar
  
    # The instance method `sugar=` is an attribute write,

    # this is called a setter.

    # The following will create an attribute reader method
    # like the method above for sugar. It will return the
    # value of the @butter. This shortcut exist because
    # this pattern is commonplace.
    # attr_reader :butter
    # attr_writer :butter
  
    # This is shortcut for creating a reader and writer
