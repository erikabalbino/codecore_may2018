-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

-- These allows to do calculations on data we get from
-- our query. This usually means combining into a
-- smaller set of data.

-- COUNT

-- Get the number of students in the database

-- SELECT count(*) FROM students;

-- Use AS to alias the name of a column. This will
-- change its name in the results.

-- SELECT count(*) AS student_count FROM students;

-- SUM

-- Find out the total years life experience of
-- all students

-- AVG

-- Find out the average age of all students in the db

-- ROUND is not an AGGREGATE FUNCTION. It's simply
-- a math function that rounds a number.

-- MAX & MIN
